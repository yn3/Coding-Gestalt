Outlines of Shapes
==================


## Photobooth

* Let's take a photo of all participants!
* You can get the processing app [here](https://github.com/craftoid/photobooth).


## Three Ways to Analyze Gestalt

* Let others do it (GWAP, Mechanical Turk)
* Let the CPU do it (Processing)
* Let the GPU do it (Processing + Shaeders)
* Find a Library that does it
* Do it yourself (Pen + Paper)

Check out the [tools](../tools) section of our repo.  
(Continuously updated ...)


## Live Image Processing

* How to use the Camera with Processing
* What's in a Pixel?
* Simple Image Transformations


## Using Video

The [Video Source Library](https://github.com/bitcraftlab/videosource) provides a common Interface to different kinds of Video Input.

* Camera Input
* Animated Gifs
* OGG
 
Check out the [Video Loops Example](https://github.com/bitcraftlab/videosource/tree/master/examples/video_loops).


## Finding Outlines

1. Threshold Filter
2. Extract Outlines
3. Remove Shapes
4. Repeat
