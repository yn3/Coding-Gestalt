Exercises — Skeletons of Shapes
===============================### [Exercise 01][] — Create a Silhouette
1. Create a Silhouette + Document the process (1 image, 3 sentences)
2. Turn the silouette into a 400x400 PNG
3. Create a Processing sketch to display the image

### [Exercise 02][] — Image Thinning

1. Pick one of those approaches 
2. Implement it in Processing
3. Visualize the Process of Thinning

### [Exercise 03][] — Skeletonization

1. Write a function that identifies critical pixels
   (i.e. Pixels which cannot be deleted without changing the topology)
2. Use the function to turn your thinning algorithm into a skeletonization algorithm

Answer the following questions:

* What makes a "good" skeleton
* Does your algorithm create a good skeleton. Why?

### [Exercise 04][] — Growing Muscles

Can you reconstruct the original shape from a skeleton?
